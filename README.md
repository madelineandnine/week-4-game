# week-4-game

### Overview
In this project, I created an interactive game for web browsers using jQuery.

### Project
In this project, there are four crystal "buttons" which are assigned a random value between 1 and 12. There's a generated random number between 19 and 120. Each button is assigned a value which is added every time its pressed. The total sum is added up in a box at the bottom of the screen. When you hit the generated random number exactly, you win and an alert will pop up. If you overshoot the generated random number, you lose and an alert will pop up. The generated random number will reset. All button random values should print out in console as well, for checking purposes.
